## What and Why

### Why are they useful?

[git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) prevent you from losing work if you accidentally delete your files, or something terrible happens to your computer.

They also make it easy to collaborate with others on the same project without worrying about if everyone is on the same version.

You are also provided a history of every change, and if working with others, who made those changes.

### What is git?

git is a [command line (or terminal, or command prompt)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tool that lets you easily track changes to your files so you no longer have to name files doc_version_1.txt, doc_version_2.txt, doc_final.txt, doc_final_final.txt.

git also makes it easy for you to separate your work into chunks (more commonly known as [branches](#branching-and-merging) and merge everything back together later.

You may hear it called a version control system, or VCS

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website that works with git, so you can store your files online, similar to Dropbox or Google Drive.

With GitHub being online, that makes it easy for you to share your work with others, and collaborate on a project together.

## Setup

### Install Git

Note: you only have to do this once. If you already have git, you can skip this step.

1. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Click your specific operating system
  * If you are on Windows, set git to use Git Bash only, and agree with the rest of the defaults.

### Creating a GitHub account

Note: you only have to do this once. If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip this step.

1. Go to [github.com](github.com)
2. Click continue through all the steps
  * You can choose to tailor your experience if you want. I do not know what effect it has on your account.

## Repository Creation

1. To start a local repository, you run

    ```shell
    git init
    ```

## Adding Files and Making Changes

1. To select files that you have changed, you run

    ```shell
    git commit
    ```

1. To list what files have changed, you run

    ```shell
    git ANSWER
    ```

1. To list the specific changes in a file, you run

    ```shell
    git diff
    ```

1. To record changes that have been made, you run

    ```shell
    git ANSWER
    ```

1. To see the history of changes, you run

    ```shell
    git log
    ```

1. To connect a local repository to a remote one, you run

    ```shell
    git commit -m
    ```

1. To send your files and changes to a remote repository, you first run

    ```shell
    git ANSWER
    ```

1. Once you have initially sent your files to the remote, you can then run

    ```shell
    git ANSWER
    ```

## Branching and Merging

1. To start a new branch, you run

    ```shell
    git branch
    ```

1. To list branches, you run

    ```shell
    git branch
    ```

1. To change branches, you run

    ```shell
    git checkout
    ```

1. To merge branches, you run

    ```shell
    git merge
    ```

To handle merge conflicts, you will need to manually go through the file(s) with conflicts and pick the changes you want to keep.

## Collaborating

1. To copy a repository from GitHub to your machine, you run

    ```shell
    git cd git
    ```

1. To connect your local repository to a remote repo you are not a member of, you run

    ```shell
    git push
    ```

1. To pull in changes someone else has made, you run

    ```shell
    git pull
    ```

## Bonus Material

### Compact Log Command

```shell
git log --pretty=format:\"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]\" --graph --date=short
```

### Private Repositories

By default, GitHub makes your repositories public. This is great for [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) work.

If you want your work to be private, you either need to

* Have a student account
* Pay for GitHub
* Switch to another service like BitBucket, which gives you a few free private repositories

### Deleting Branches

To delete a branch, you want to run

```shell
git branch -D name-of-branch
```

Replace `name-of-branch` with whatever the name of your branch is.
